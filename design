Design
X    * multiple rows of horiz. moving lines of "turtles", each row different shape, with gaps in between for frogger to pass
X    * user moves frogger around (up,down,L, R)
X    * frogger dies, respawns at bottom, if collides with moving turtle
X    * lose if run out of lives
X    * Win if makes it to top row (no turtles there)
X    * display of score, lives left  (score incremented when Frogger reaches another row)


Iterations:
X    1) moving line of turtles, continously scrolling across screen
X    2) 2nd moving line (opposite dir)
X    3) Frogger, movable in 4 directions using keyboard
X    4) Collision detection
X    6) Reset, lost life, upon collision  
X    7) Game Over Screen if dies too many times
X    8) add safe row at top, and Win screen


Enhancements:
X    * several more rows
X    * Better Frogger gif that actually looks like frog, turns left/right
X    * Different types of traffic besides just turtles
    * inverted row: landing on turtle is OK, inbetween is fail
        ** if land on turtle, Frogger moves with it
    * allow import of gif filenames to be used for traffic vehicles
